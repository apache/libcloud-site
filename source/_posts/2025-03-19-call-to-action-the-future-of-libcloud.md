We've reached an important crossroads for Apache Libcloud. The project has
been running for nearly **15 years**, serving as a stable and widely used
abstraction layer for cloud services. Over the years, we've seen **a steady
stream of contributions** - new drivers, bug fixes, small enhancements, and
automation improvements.

However, **sustaining long-term project health has always been a challenge**,
and in recent years, the situation has become more pressing. This is a
**call to action** for maintainers and contributors who can help ensure
Libcloud continues to serve its users.

## The Challenge

Libcloud follows a **driver/adapter pattern**, meaning it consists of **many
individual drivers** for different cloud providers. Naturally, **most
contributors are only interested in a specific driver**, fixing or adding
features for the one they use. This is completely understandable and has been
the case since the beginning. **Apache Jclouds**, a similar project in Java,
faced the same issue. This is a common challenge for projects like this - where
core maintainers are responsible for the entire project while most
contributions remain localized.

We're incredibly grateful for all contributions, **big or small**, but the
reality is that maintaining **the overall project health** requires a group of
dedicated maintainers, which we have struggled with.

### The Minimum Required to Keep Libcloud Healthy

According to **[Apache PMC guidelines](https://www.apache.org/foundation/
governance/pmcs.html)**, every project needs at least **three active PMC
members** to provide **basic oversight**, including:

- Monitoring and responding to **security vulnerabilities**
- Keeping **dependencies up to date**
- Ensuring **the project remains functional**

Currently, the project's maintenance responsibilities are not evenly
distributed, which is not sustainable in the long term.

Like all open-source projects, Libcloud’s long-term sustainability depends
on active participation. If the project no longer meets the minimum oversight
requirements, the community will need to discuss its future, including the
possibility of retirement and movement to the **[Apache Attic](https://attic.apache.org/)**.

While I recognize that every project eventually reaches its natural end-of-life,
**Libcloud is still widely used**, and projects continue to depend on it.
It would be unfortunate to see it discontinued simply due to a lack of
maintainers.

That said, if the **community and PMC members** believe that retiring the
project is the best course of action, we will of course follow that decision.
Our goal is to ensure that Libcloud is maintained as long as it remains useful,
but ultimately, the project's future should reflect the needs and capacity of
its community.

## Call to Action

We're looking for contributors who can **help with basic project maintenance
and oversight**. The **bar for involvement isn't high**, but **minimum commitment
is key**. Ideally, we're looking for people who:

- **Use Libcloud regularly** in a meaningful way
- Have experience contributing to **Libcloud or similar open-source projects**
- Are willing to **help with security oversight, dependencies, and general
  maintenance**

If you're interested, **please reach out**. You can post on our
[developer mailing list](mailto:dev@libcloud.apache.org), introduce yourself,
and let us know how you'd like to contribute.

We're **open to discussions** on how to make involvement easier. If you use
Libcloud and find it valuable, we encourage you to get involved. Contributions
of all sizes help ensure the project remains healthy and sustainable.

## What's Next for Libcloud?

At this stage, I **don't expect any major evolutions**. **Keeping things up to
date** and **making sure security issues are handled** should be enough to keep
the project in a healthy state.

That said, I'd be **happy to be proven wrong**. If someone is interested in
**larger contributions, new APIs, or major improvements**, you are, of course,
**more than welcome**. But first and foremost, **we need to ensure the project
remains maintainable and sustainable**.

## Thank You

Before closing, I want to **thank everyone** who has contributed to Libcloud
over the years—whether it was a **bug fix, a new driver, documentation
improvements, or ongoing maintenance**.

To all past and present contributors, committers, and PMC members: **thank
you** for your dedication and hard work. And to those who have moved on to new
projects and challenges, **I wish you all the best**. Your efforts helped shape
Libcloud into what it is today.

If you'd like to be part of **Libcloud's future**, **now is the time to get
involved**. Let's **keep this project alive and thriving**.

**Thank you.**
