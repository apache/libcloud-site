## Accepted Projects

### Libcloud REST

HTTP interface for Libcloud (http://libcloud.apache.org/) which exposes
all the Libcloud functionality through a RESTful API. Currently Libcloud
has a big limitation - you can only use it with Python. Adding a REST
interface would allow users to leverage Libcloud functionality through an
arbitrary language which knows how to talk HTTP.
