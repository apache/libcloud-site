  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Today we are happy to announce various website updates. Here is a short
summary of those updates.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move from svn to git for storing the website source code and the
generated static content (<a href="https://github.com/apache/libcloud-site">https://github.com/apache/libcloud-site</a>)</li>
  <li>New Docker image to make it easier to build and contribute to the website</li>
  <li>Upgrades to the various software and libraries used to build and serve
the website (Jekyll, Ruby, Ruby Gems, jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.).</li>
  <li>Dark mode / theme for the website</li>
  <li>Removal of Google tracking code (Google Analytics, Google Fonts)</li>
  <li>Removal of various Ruby gems which are not needed to build the website</li>
  <li>Other minor styling improvements</li>
</ul>

<div class="imginline">
  <p><img src="/images/posts/tbd/dark_theme.png" class="img-responsive inline" /></p>
  <p class="img-caption">Website using dark mode.</p>
</div>

<p>More on that below.</p>

<h2 id="background-context">Background, Context</h2>

<p>It has been over 8 years since the new static <a href="https://libcloud.apache.org/blog/2014/01/23/welcome-to-the-new-website.html">Jekyll powered website has
been launched</a>.</p>

<p>8 years is a long time and since then a lot has changed. Especially in the web
world, but the website stayed more or less the same.</p>

<p>Since the website is purely static and doesn’t contain any dynamic server side
components this means that not updating the software which is used to build the
website has no negative security implications for the end users (that’s a nice
thing about all the static website generators). This is vastly different if you
run a server side CMS such as Wordpress or similar where you need to make sure
it’s always up to date with the latest security patches.</p>

<p>Main problem with using old software (Ruby, Jekyll) was that it was very hard
to reproduce local development environment which made it almost impossible for
others to contribute - even I had issues with reproducing the environment in
the past year.</p>

<p>We used Ruby 1.9 and Jekyll 1.5 which were both almost 8 years old and
officially deprecated and non-supported for many years already.</p>

<p>At first, I only wanted to create a Docker image with this old software which
would make it easier for other people to contribute and build the website
locally.</p>

<p>It turned out that even that is very hard now because of the various old
versions of the software and libraries that software depends on. After
many hours, I did <a href="https://libcloud.apache.org/blog/2014/01/23/welcome-to-the-new-website.html">get it to work</a>, but I decide to try to go a step
further and see if I can actually update Ruby and Jekyll.</p>

<p>And surely, it turned out that’s not an easy task either. Over the years,
Jekyll had many releases with breaking changes and to make things worse, we
also utilize some custom Jekyll plugins which needed to be updated (I was
actually already somewhat aware I’m opening a can of worms because I
already tried to do that a couple of times in the past, but each time I
decided to abandon those efforts since it required too much work / time).</p>

<p>In the end, after addressing all of those various issues and breaking changes,
I got everything to work.</p>

<p>To make contributing even easier and faster, we also provide a pre-built Docker
image with the development environment which should save some time and CPU
cycles since the image doesn’t need to be built locally (sadly the image is on
the larger side because a lot of tooling is needed to build the website - I do
hope to reduce that a bit in a future when I get a chance by using a multi
stage build).</p>

<p>Since I was already working on the website I also decided to make a bunch of
other changes, my favorite one being dark mode / theme. I personally already
use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/sl/firefox/addon/darkreader/">Dark Reader extension for Firefox</a> which automatically provides dark
mode for most websites on the fly, but I know now everyone is using something
like that and a native dark mode / theme is usually better.</p>

<p>The source code and everything else for the new website is available at
<a href="https://github.com/apache/libcloud-site">https://github.com/apache/libcloud-site</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>We hope you will enjoy those new changes and most importantly, we hope
those changes will decrease the barrier to entry and make contributing to
the website easier and faster.</p>

<p>P.S. If you find any bugs or issues with those changes (especially the dark
theme), please feel free to report them or, if possible, contribute the fix
directly - that would be much appreciated.</p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>We are happy to announce Libcloud v3.4.1.</p>

<p>This is a bug fix release which fixes an installation bug that was inadvertently
introduced in v3.4.0.</p>

<p>That bug broke installation under Python 3.5 and it also prevented Libcloud
from being installed inside the same (virtual) environment where older version
of the requests library was already installed or where some other dependency
depends on older version of the requests library.</p>

<h3 id="note-on-python-35-support">Note on Python 3.5 support</h3>

<p>Libcloud v3.4.x will be the last release series which still supports Python
3.5.</p>

(<a href="https://endoflife.date/python">https://endoflife.date/python</a>) now and a lot of libraries (including some we
depend on) have already dropped support for it.</p>

<p>This is making it increasingly hard for us to still support Python 3.5 since
it requires a bunch of edge cases in workarounds in our code and build system.</p>

  <span class="post-date-author">By Tomaz Muraus on Aug 31, 2020</span>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Please help us extend a warm welcome to our newest team member <a href="https://github.com/micafer">Miguel Caballer</a>!</p>

<p>The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Libcloud has invited Miguel
Caballer to join us as a committer and we are pleased to announce that he
has accepted.</p>

<p>Miguel has been part of the Libcloud community for many years now and during
his participation he made various contributions to the project, majority of
them focusing on our OpenStack drivers.</p>

<p>For anyone who would like to know more about Miguel here is his short bio:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Miguel Caballer is part of the Grid and High Performance Computing group of
UPV since 2001. He is the lead developer of the Infrastructure Manager (IM),
a tool that deploys complex and customized virtual infrastructures on IaaS
Cloud deployments. He has participated in different research projects about
the application of Grid and Cloud computing techniques to several areas of
engineering. Other fields of interest include green computing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in his own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I start the development of the IM (in python) I found that Libcloud was
the best option to connect with different cloud back-ends using a single
library and using the same basic set of functions calls. It has improved a
lot in the last years adding extra functionality for each connector that makes
it a really good alternative to native libraries. My main contributions has been
mainly related with the OpenStack driver, one of the most user cloud providers
by the IM tool. I’m very proud to be an Apache Libcloud team member and I will
continue with my contributions.</p>

  <span class="post-date-author">By Tomaz Muraus on Aug 02, 2020</span>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Recently we added a new job to our CI / CD which runs daily and retrieves latest
pricing data for various providers and publishes pricing.json file which can be
used by Libcloud to a public read-only S3 bucket.</p>

<p>More information on where to download it and how to use this file can be found in
<a href="https://libcloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compute/pricing.html#downloading-latest-pricing-data-from-an-s3-bucket">our documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="background-context">Background, Context</h2>

<p>In the past, we ran the script which updates pricing.json file which is bundled
with each Libcloud release just before publishing a new release.</p>

<p>The problem is that the pricing data can change often, so updating it only once
every couple of months as part of a Libcloud release is not sufficient.</p>

<p>To solve for that problem, we now update and publish pricing.json file which
includes latest retrieved pricing data for various providers on a daily basis.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that we can’t guarantee 100% accuracy of this data so you
should only use this data as estimate and you should never rely solely on
Libcloud pricing data.</p>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>

<p>We would like to extend special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Eis-D-Z">Eis D. Zaster</a> who has
contributed new scraping scripts for multiple providers and also made
various improvements and fixes to the existing scraping scripts.</p>

<p>In addition to that, we would like to thank <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-promotional-credits-open-source-projects/">Amazon Web Services</a> which
granted us free credits for their EC2 and S3 service which we plan to use
for hosting this pricing file, end to end tests and more.</p>

  <li>New standard “prefix” keyword argument in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{list,iterate}_container_objects</code>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>We are happy to announce Libcloud v3.0.0-rc1.</p>

<p>This is the first release candidate for Libcloud v3.0.0 which includes many 
changes, the biggest one being dropping support for Python 2.7 and 
Python 3 &lt; 3.5.</p>

<p>Since this is a first release which drops support for those Python versions,
we want to give our users some time to opt-in and test it and verify
everything works as expected, before we produce a stable v3.0.0 release.</p>

<p>Other highlights include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Type annotations for the base storage API</li>
  <li>Various improvements in the Azure Blobs driver</li>
  <li>New standard “prefix” keyword argument in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{list,iterate}_container_objects</code>
methods</li>
  <li>2 new compute drivers (KubeVirt, LXD)</li>
</ul>

<p>If no major issues are found, this release candidate (with any other fixes
which accumulate in trunk until then) will become a stable v3.0.0 release
some time in the near future.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this is a pre-release so it won’t be installed by pip
by default when you run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip install apache-libcloud</code>.</p>

<p>To install it, you need to explicitly specify a version as shown in the

    <p>We are pleased to announce the release of Libcloud 2.8.0.</p>

<p>This release includes various changes, most notable ones being:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Distribution now includes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">py.typed</code> file which signals mypy that
this package contains type annotations (currently only for the
base compute API).</li>
  <li>Fix wheel metadata. There was a bug where conditional dependencies
were not specified correctly so it would try to install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">typing</code>
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enum34</code> dependency on Python versions where there is not needed.</li>
  <li>Fix <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get_driver()</code> bug / regression not working if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">provider</code>
argument was a string and not a Provider ENUM.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dropping-support-for-python-27-and-python-34">Dropping support for Python 2.7 and Python 3.4</h3>

<p>The plan was for v2.7.0 to be the last major release before v3.0.0 which
drops support for Python 2.7 and Python 3.4, but this has changed since
v2.7.0 introduced some small regressions / bugs which needed to be fixed.</p>

<p>If no major issues are found in this release, this will be the
last release before v3.0.0 which drops support for those Python
versions.</p>

<p>For more information on dropping support for Python 2.7 and Python 3.4, please

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>We are pleased to announce the release of Libcloud 2.7.0.</p>

<p>Among various smaller bug fixes, this release also includes a couple of big
new features.</p>

<p>Highlights include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Initial type annotations / hints support for the base Libcloud compute API.</li>
  <li>S3 driver class has been updated to support <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">region</code> argument in the same
manner as other drivers which support multiple regions (no more messy class
per region approach). For backward compatibility reasons, “class per region”
approach will still be supported until the next major release.</li>
  <li>New <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start_node()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stop_node()</code> method have been added to the base
Libcloud compute API and the existing drivers which implement
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ex_start_node()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ex_stop_node()</code> methods have been updated to
implement those new methods. Old <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ex_</code> methods will continue to work for
backward compatibility reasons.</li>
</ul>

<p>Full change log can be found at

<h3 id="dropping-support-for-python-27-and-python-34">Dropping support for Python 2.7 and Python 3.4</h3>

<p>Libcloud was among some of the other early larger Python projects which have
supported Python 2.x and Python 3.x simultaneously using a single code base
from 2011.</p>

<p>Over the years, the landscape has changed a lot. A lot of the users now use
Python 3 as a default and a lot of the popular Python projects now not only
support Python 3, but also make Python 3 the only supported Python version.</p>

<p>In addition to that, <a href="https://pythonclock.org/">Python 2.7 will not be maintained past January 2020</a>.</p>

<p>We have decided to sign the <a href="https://python3statement.org/">Python 3 statement</a> and drop support for Python
2.7 and Python 3.4 in the next major release (v3.0.0) which will coincide
with Python 2.7 EOL early next year.</p>

<p>This means that Libcloud v2.7.0 will be the last major release which still
supports Python 2.7 and 3.4.</p>

<p>The change itself is still work in progress. People who are interested in it
can check the following PR <a href="https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1377">https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1377</a>.</p>

<h4 id="how-does-this-affect-me">How does this affect me?</h4>

<p>If you still need to use Python 2.7 or Python 3.4 after Libcloud v3.0.0 is
out, you will be able to do that by utilizing one of the older Libcloud
releases which still supports that Python version.</p>

<p>All the new feature development and improvements will land in new release
which support Python &gt;= 3.5 only, but we may still do a release in the
v2.7.x release series if a major bug or a security issue is found.</p>

<h4 id="how-does-this-affect-the-libcloud-development-team">How does this affect the Libcloud development team?</h4>

<p>Supporting Python 2.x and Python 3.x through a single code base was never
totally trivial.</p>

<p>This is especially true for our project which doesn’t use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">six</code> Python 2
/ 3 compatibility library, but uses custom glue / wrapper code for that.</p>

<p>There are multiple reasons why we didn’t use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">six</code> - one is that we still
needed to support Python 2.5 which is not supported by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">six</code> and another
one is that we didn’t want to introduce another dependency on the end user in
the days where Python packaging was still very much in the infancy.</p>

<p>Dropping support for Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 will allow us to streamline our
code and remove a lot of the code which is not needed anymore.</p>

<p>This will result in easier development and cleaner code.</p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Please help us extend a warm welcome to our newest team member <a href="https://github.com/c-w">Clemens
Wolff</a>!</p>

<p>The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Libcloud has invited Clemens
Wolff to join us as a committer and we are pleased to announce that he
has accepted.</p>

<p>Clemens has participated in the Libcloud community for a while now and during
his participation he made a <a href="https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ac-w">number of high quality contributions to the
project</a>.</p>

<p>For anyone who would like to know more about Clemens here is his short bio:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clemens Wolff is a tech lead in Microsoft’s Commercial Software
Engineering team, enabling customers from around the world to create scalable,
resilient and efficient software solutions applying relevant technologies and
platforms, including cloud computing, highly scalable data engines, machine
learning and analytics, and distributed messaging systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in his own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was introduced to Libcloud while working with a research group at Imperial
College London on porting OKpy, an open source computer science classroom
management system, from GCP to Azure. OKpy uses Libcloud which made
migrating the object storage needs of the application a breeze. Since this
initial exposure, I’ve been using Libcloud on many projects to ensure
cross-cloud compatibility and to simplify testing via the local provider
implementations. Most of my contributions have been about maintaining and
updating the Azure implementation of Libcloud’s storage driver and
building test automation to ensure that Libcloud can seamlessly be used
with Azure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are happy to have him in our team and we are looking forward to his future
participation and contributions.</p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Please help us extend a warm welcome to our newest team member <a href="https://github.com/vdloo">Rick van de
Loo</a>!</p>

<p>The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Libcloud has invited Rick
van de Loo to join us as a committer and we are pleased to announce that he
has accepted.</p>

<p>In the last couple of years Rick has <a href="https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avdloo+is%3Aclosed">contributed various high quality
changes</a> to the project and we are happy to have him on board.</p>

<p>For anyone who would like to know more about Rick here is his short bio:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rick van de Loo is the lead developer on Hypernode, a highly automated and
cloud agnostic hosting platform specialised for Magento built on top of Apache
Libcloud. Since Rick started working on Hypernode he has seen it scale from
double digits to thousands of servers, along the road orchestrating various
high volume cross-provider migrations. His main focus is on platform
stability and feature development, of which a large part has been integrating
cloud APIs and working around their incompatibilities and unreliable nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in his own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since we started using Libcloud around four years ago the landscape has
changed a lot. But even though container-based and serverless architectures
have become more prominent, compute is still the cornerstone of cloud. Most
of my contributions have been about standardising functionality across
different compute providers and implementing new driver methods, mainly
related to the AWS, DigitalOcean and OpenStack APIs. As an Apache Libcloud
team member I will continue to contribute changes that help us scratch our
own itch and encourage other members of the Hypernode team to do the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are happy to have him in our team and we are looking forward to his future
participation and contributions.</p>

    <p>Another year is behind us. Like most of the previous years, this year included
a lot of exciting development. This post is going to present some statistics and
highlights of the year.</p>

<p>You can also dig into the numbers yourself on <a href="https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pulse">Github</a>, <a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/libcloud">Open Hub</a> and
<a href="https://projects.apache.org/project.html?libcloud">Apache Project Information</a>.</p>

<h2 id="releases">Releases</h2>

<p>This year we had 4 releases (2.0.0, 2.1.0, 2.2.0, 2.2.1). Out of that, three
major ones.</p>

<p>Libcloud 2.0.0 which was released in April represented a big milestone. We
finally moved away from our home grown HTTP abstraction layer built on top
of Python’s httplib library to the popular requests library.</p>

<p>Back in the day when the project started, requests library didn’t exist yet so
we needed to build a lot of the functionality which is now provided by requests
ourselves. Move to requests means that we now have a lot less code to maintain
and we can focus our efforts on the actual drivers which is core to Libcloud and
where the project provides value.</p>

<p>To give you an idea how much effort it took - the ground work for that change
started back in 2016 (<a href="https://libcloud.apache.org/blog/2016/04/06/requests-support.html">https://libcloud.apache.org/blog/2016/04/06/requests-support.html</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/728">https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/728</a>), but it took a lot more testing
and work to get it stable enough so we were finally able to include it as part
of the stable 2.0.0 release (and before that, we also released a couple of release
candidates so users could test and verify that their Libcloud related code
still works as expected without any regressions).</p>

<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/anthonypjshaw?lang=en">Anthony Shaw</a> for leading this effort and not giving up (the
change itself involved touching a lot of code and updating test cases for most
of the drivers which resulted in a lot of not so pleasant work and merge
conflicts).</p>

<h2 id="community">Community</h2>

<p>The community continued to grow and we have received contributions from more
than 75 different contributors. Keep in mind that this number only includes
people who contributed a code change which has been merged into trunk. The
actual number is quite a bit higher (code who didn’t get merged, people who
reported a bug or didn’t include a code change, etc).</p>

<p>We have also added one new committer - Quentin Pradet.</p>

<h2 id="ecosystem">Ecosystem</h2>

<p>In addition to various proprietary and private code bases, Libcloud continues
to be used as an important part by various open-source <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&amp;term=libcloud&amp;submit=search">projects and
libraries</a>.</p>

<p>Most notable ones include <a href="https://saltstack.com/">SaltStack</a>, <a href="https://stackstorm.com/">StackStorm</a> and <a href="https://www.google.si/search?ei=bqVGWvyGMYOXkwWlgI7gCw&amp;q=ansible&amp;oq=ansible&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i67k1j0l9.2982.2982.0.3130.1.1.0.0.0.0.99.99.1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.1.99....0.4KRxU06xPjw">Ansible</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has contributed
to the project in one form or another. No matter how small or involved, your
contribution helped project grow and push through another successful year.</p>

<p>Again, thank you, happy and successful 2018 and see you soon.</p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>We are pleased to announce the release of Libcloud 2.2.1!</p>

<p>This is a first patch release in the 2.2.x series and as such, it
includes some bug fixes and improvements.</p>

<p>The most important one of them fixes an installation of Libcloud 2.2.0
failing on some operating-system and file-system combinations (e.g.
ecryptfs layered on top of ext3/4) which don’t support file names longer
than 143 characters.</p>

<p>In addition to that, it also includes performance improvement for the
deploy functionality available to the compute drivers. Now the deploy
scripts which produce a lot of output should finish a lot faster.</p>

  <span class="post-date-author">By Anthony Shaw on Apr 09, 2017</span>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>One of the big requests whilst we were replacing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">httplib</code> with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requests</code> package in 2.0 was why didn’t
we use a HTTP library that supports <em>asynchronous</em> API calls.</p>

<p>The intention for 2.0 and replacing the HTTP backend classes was to improve the usability of the project, by making SSL
certificates easier to manage, improving the maintainability of our source code by using an active 3rd party package and
also improving performance and stability.</p>

<p>Apache Libcloud already has documentation on threaded libraries like gevent and callback-based libraries like Twisted, see
<a href="https://libcloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/other/using-libcloud-in-multithreaded-and-async-environments.html">using libcloud in multithreaded environments</a>
for examples.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/#">PEP 492</a>, implemented in Python 3.5 provides a new coroutine protocol using methods,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__await__</code> for classes, a coroutine method wrapper, or a method that returns a coroutine object.
Also async <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/#asynchronous-iterators-and-async-for">iterators</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/#asynchronous-context-managers-and-async-with">context managers</a>
have been introduced.</p>

<p>We would like to take advantage of the new language features by offering APIs in Apache Libcloud without breaking backward compatibility and
compatibility for users of &lt;Python 3.5.</p>

<p>Use cases for this would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Being able to fetch <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Node</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StorageObject</code>s from multiple geographies or drivers simultaneously.</li>
  <li>Being able to quickly upload or download storage objects by parallelizing operations on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StorageDriver</code>.</li>
  <li>Being able to call a long-running API method (e.g. generate report), whilst running other code.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design-1---async-context-managers-pr-1016">Design 1 - async context managers <a href="https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1016">PR 1016</a></h2>

<p>This design would allow drivers to operate in 2 modes, the first is for synchronous method calls, they return list or object
data as per usual. The second mode, API methods like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NodeDriver.list_nodes</code> would return a <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/#coroutine-objects">coroutine object</a>
and could be awaited or gathered using an event loop.</p>

<h2 id="design-2---additional-methods-in-each-driver-for-coroutines-pr-1027">Design 2 - Additional methods in each driver for coroutines <a href="https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1027">PR 1027</a></h2>

<p>This is the second design concept for async support in Libcloud.</p>

<p>The concept here is to have Asynchronous Mixins, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LibcloudConnection</code> uses requests and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LibcloudAsyncConnection</code> uses aiohttp for async transport <a href="https://github.com/tonybaloney/libcloud/blob/d4fe097476d2f02941e17d5e1b1d405fcf44c0f7/libcloud/connection_async.py#L22-L42">see</a></p>

<p>The LibcloudAsyncConnection is an implementation detail of AsyncConnection, which is the API for the drivers to consume <a href="https://github.com/tonybaloney/libcloud/blob/d4fe097476d2f02941e17d5e1b1d405fcf44c0f7/libcloud/common/base.py#L742-L778">see</a></p>

<p>The drivers then use this mixin for their custom connection classes, e.g.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">GoogleStorageConnection</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ConnectionUserAndKey</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">AsyncConnection</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>

</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>They then inherit from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libcloud.storage.base.StorageAsyncDriver</code>, which uses a new set of base methods, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iterate_containers_async</code> and can be implemented like this:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>        <span class="k">async</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">iterate_containers_async</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>

                                                 <span class="n">xpath</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'Buckets/Bucket'</span><span class="p">)</span>
                <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">containers</span>

<h2 id="design-3---initializer-with-async-mode">Design 3 - Initializer with “<em>async</em>” mode</h2>

<p>This option is similar to 2, except that if a driver is instantiated with “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">async=True</code>”,
then all driver class methods would return coroutine objects. Internally, it would
patch the Connection class with the AsyncConnection class.</p>

<p>The downside of this is that all method calls to a driver would need to be awaited or used
by an event loop.</p>

<p>Got a better idea? Have an API or design, the question we’re asking is 
“if you wanted to use Libcloud for an async application, what would the code look like?” This helps us design
the API and the implementation details can follow.</p>

<p>Feel free to comment on the mailing list or on the pull requests, or raise your own pull-request with an API design.</p>

<h3 id="important-breaking-change---amazon-ec2-driver-changes">Important breaking change-  Amazon EC2 driver changes</h3>

<p>The Amazon EC2 API was updated to consolidate the regional-based drivers into a single driver with a region argument in the constructor.</p>

<p>Amazon Instances should now be instantiated using the following syntax:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">libcloud.compute.types</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Provider</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">libcloud.compute.providers</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">get_driver</span>

<span class="n">cls</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">get_driver</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Provider</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">EC2</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">driver</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cls</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'access key'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'secret key'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">region</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'us-east-1'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This brings the Amazon API inline with the other drivers, makes it easier to maintain and switch between regions.</p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

<h4 id="general">General</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fix a bug with consuming stdout and stderr in the paramiko SSH client which
would manifest itself under very rare condition when a consumed chunk only
contained a single byte or part of a multi byte UTF-8 character.
[Lakshmi Kannan, Tomaz Muraus]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increase default chunk size from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1024</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4096</code> bytes in the paramiko
SSH client. This results in smaller number of receive calls on the average.
[Tomaz Muraus]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix to Dimension Data API address for Middle-East and Africa
(GITHUB-700)
[Anthony Shaw]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throw a more user-friendly exception on “No address associated with hostname”.
(GITHUB-711, GITHUB-714, LIBCLOUD-803)
[Tomaz Muraus, Scott Crunkleton]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remove deprecated provider constants with the region in the name and related
driver classes (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EC2_US_EAST</code>, etc.).</p>

  <span class="post-date-author">By Anthony Shaw on Apr 11, 2016</span>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>We are pleased to announce the release of Libcloud 1.0.0-rc2.</p>

<p>This the second pre-release in the 1.0.0 series which means it brings many new
features, improvements, bug-fixes, and DNS drivers.</p>

<h3 id="release-highlights">Release highlights</h3>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deprecated drivers that were no longer available such as Ninefold, IBM SCE <a href="http://libcloud.apache.org/blog/2016/02/16/new-drivers-deprecated-drivers.html">more details</a></li>
  <li>The Amazon EC2 driver has been changed to use region codes instead of separate drivers for each region.</li>
  <li>Introduce new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">list_regions</code> class method on the base driver class</li>
  <li>Support for Dimension Data backup</li>
  <li>Added NSOne, LuaDNS, NearlyFreeSpeech.NET DNS drivers</li>
  <li>Added Aliyun compute, load balancer and storage drivers</li>
  <li>Added Outscale storage driver</li>
</ul>

<p>Full change log can be found at <a href="https://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/changelog.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="important-breaking-change---amazon-ec2-driver-changes">Important breaking change-  Amazon EC2 driver changes</h3>

<p>The Amazon EC2 API was updated to consolidate the regional-based drivers into a single driver with a region argument in the constructor.</p>

<p>Amazon Instances should now be instantiated using the following syntax:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">libcloud.compute.types</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Provider</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">libcloud.compute.providers</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">get_driver</span>

<span class="n">cls</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">get_driver</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Provider</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">EC2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">region</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'us-east-i1'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">driver</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cls</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'access key'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'secret key'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This brings the Amazon API inline with the other drivers, makes it easier to maintain and switch between regions.</p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

<h4 id="general">General</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fix a bug with consuming stdout and stderr in the paramiko SSH client which
would manifest itself under very rare condition when a consumed chunk only
contained a single byte or part of a multi byte UTF-8 character.
[Lakshmi Kannan, Tomaz Muraus]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increase default chunk size from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1024</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4096</code> bytes in the paramiko
SSH client. This results in smaller number of receive calls on the average.

    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/blog/2016/04/06/requests-support.html">Experimental support for the requests package</a></h2>
  
  <span class="post-date-author">By Anthony Shaw on Apr 06, 2016</span>

  <div class="post-content">
    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I’ve just pushed a branch of the latest version of libcloud using the popular <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requests</code> package by Kenneth Reitz instead of our home-rolled HTTP client library.</p>

<p>This article is for both users and developers of libcloud. If you want to give feedback, please join the developer mailing list.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>requests is the defacto standard - it would be in the standard library but agreed against to allow it to develop faster https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/2424</li>
  <li>it works with python 2.6-&gt;3.5</li>
  <li>Our SSL experience has a lot to be desired for Windows users, having to download the CA cert package and setting environment variables just to get SSL working</li>
  <li>Developers can use requests_mock for deeper integration testing</li>
  <li>less code to maintain</li>
  <li>the role of libcloud is for cloud abstraction, we provide no value in writing and maintaining our own HTTP client library</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="benefits-of-requests">Benefits of requests</h2>

<p>There are a number of benefits to having a requests package</p>

<ul>
  <li>The client library code is smaller, leaner and simpler.</li>
  <li>Requests has built in decompression support, we no longer need to support this</li>
  <li>Requests has built in RAW download, upload support, helping with our storage drivers</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implications-of-the-change">Implications of the change</h2>

<ul>
  <li>There are no longer 2 classes (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LibcloudHTTPSConnection</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LibcloudHTTPConnection</code>) to be provided to each driver, they are now 1 class - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LibcloudConnection</code>. You probably won’t notice this because it is a property of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Connection</code> class, but
if you are developing or extending functionality then it is implicated.</li>
  <li>Unit tests will look slightly different (see below)</li>
  <li>This change broke 4200 unit tests (out of 6340)! I’ve since fixed them all since they were coupled to the original implementation, but now I don’t know if all of tests are valid.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="testing-with-requests">Testing with requests</h2>

<p>Unit tests that were written like this:</p>

<p>The package is on my personal apache site, you can download it and install it in a virtualenv for testing.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip install -e http://people.apache.org/~anthonyshaw/libcloud/1.0.0-rc2-requests/apache-libcloud-1.0.0-rc2-requests.zip@feature#egg=apache-libcloud</code></p>

<p>The hashes are my <a href="http://people.apache.org/~anthonyshaw/libcloud/1.0.0-rc2-requests/">apache space</a></p>

<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/728/files">PR and the change set</a> for a list of changes</p>

<h1 id="what-might-break">What might break?</h1>

<p>What I’m really looking for is for users of Libcloud to take 15 minutes, an existing (working) libcloud script, install this package in a virtualenv and just validate
that there are no regression bugs with this change.</p>

<p>I’m particularly sceptical about the storage drivers.</p>

<p>Once we have enough community feedback, we will propose a vote to merge this into trunk for future release.</p>

  <span class="post-date-author">By Anthony Shaw on Feb 16, 2016</span>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>With Libcloud 1.0.0 around the corner, it’s time to have a spring clean of the compute drivers. Granted, it’s not spring everywhere -actually
I’m writing from Sydney, Australia where it’s definitely summer.</p>

<p>Looking at the 52 providers in the 0.21.0 release, I have identified 5 providers that are no longer available or open.</p>

<h3 id="handling-deprecated-drivers">Handling deprecated drivers</h3>

<p>For 1.0.0, we need a clean and user-friendly way of handling deprecated drivers as well as keeping the repository clean from legacy code.</p>

<p>The most obvious implementation is that calls to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get_driver(Provider.NINEFOLD)</code> as an example will return a user error message saying
this provider is no longer supported with a link to a new article and an alternative solution.</p>

<p>Currently, users trying to instantiate a HPE public cloud driver for example will get a connection error, which is not user friendly.</p>

<h3 id="new-compute-drivers-in-100-pre2">New compute drivers in 1.0.0-pre2</h3>

  <span class="post-date-author">By Anthony Shaw on Feb 05, 2016</span>

  <div class="post-content">
    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Containers are the talk of the town, you can’t escape an event or meetup without someone talking about containers. The lessons we
learnt with compute abstraction are applying widely with containers in 2016. APIs are not consistent between clouds, designs are not
standardised and yet, users are trying to consume multiple services.</p>

<p>We introduced Container-as-a-Service support in <a href="http://libcloud.apache.org/blog/2016/01/26/libcloud-1-0-0-pre1-released.html">1.0.0-pre1</a>, a community pre-release with the intention of sparking feedback from 
the open-source community about the design and the implementation of 4 example drivers :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Docker</li>
  <li>Joyent Triton</li>
  <li>Amazon EC2 Container Service</li>
  <li>Google Kubernetes</li>
</ul>

<p>In this tutorial we’re going to explore how to do this:</p>

<div class="imginline">
  <p><img src="/images/posts/2016-02-05-containers/container_cloud_example.png" class="img-responsive inline" /></p>
  <p class="img-caption">Deploying containers across platforms.</p>
</div>

<p>Pulling images from the Docker hub, deploying to Docker, Kubernetes and Amazon ECS then auditing them with a single query.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-with-100-pre1">Getting Started with 1.0.0-pre1</h2>

<p>First off, let’s install the new packages, you probably want to do this within a virtualenv if you’re using Apache Libcloud for other projects.</p>

<p>So run these commands at a Linux Shell to create a virtualenv called ‘containers’ and install the pre-release packages into that environment.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>   virtualenv containers
   <span class="nb">cd </span>containers
   <span class="nb">source </span>bin/activate
   pip <span class="nb">install </span>apache-libcloud<span class="o">==</span>1.0.0-pre1
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now you can start using this package with a test script, let’s create one called containers.py</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>   <span class="nb">touch </span>containers.py
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Using your favourite text editor, update that file to import the 1.0.0-pre1 libraries and the factory methods for instantiating containers.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>   <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">libcloud.container.providers</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">get_driver</span>
   <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">libcloud.container.types</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Provider</span>
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get_driver</code> is a factory method as with all libcloud APIs, you call this method with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Provider</code> that you want to instantiate. Our options are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Provider.DOCKER</code> - Standalone Docker API</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Provider.KUBERNETES</code> - Kubernetes Cluster endpoint</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Provider.JOYENT</code> - Joyent Triton Public API</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Provider.ECS</code> - Amazon EC2 Container Service</li>
</ul>

<p>Calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get_driver</code> will return a reference to the driver class that you requested. You can then instantiate that class into an object using the 
contructor. This is always a set of parameters for setting the host or region, the authentication and any other options.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>   <span class="n">driver</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">get_driver</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Provider</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">DOCKER</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now we can call our driver and get an instance of it called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker_driver</code> and use that to deploy a container. For Docker you need the pem files on the server,
the host (IP or FQDN) and the port.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>   <span class="n">docker_driver</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">driver</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">host</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'https://198.61.239.128'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">port</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">4243</span><span class="p">,</span>
             <span class="n">key_file</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'key.pem'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">cert_file</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'cert.pem'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Docker requires that images are available in the image database before they can be deployed as containers. With Kubernetes and Amazon ECS this step is not required
as when you deploy a container it carries out that download for you.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>   <span class="n">image</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">driver</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">install_image</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'tomcat:8.0'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now that Docker has the version 8.0 image of Apache Tomcat, you can deploy this as a container called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my_tomcat_container</code>. Tomcat runs on TCP/8080 by default so we 
want to bind that port for our container using an optional parameter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">port_bindings</code></p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>   <span class="n">bindings</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s">"22/tcp"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[{</span> <span class="s">"HostPort"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"11022"</span> <span class="p">}]</span> <span class="p">}</span>
   <span class="n">container</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">driver</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">deploy_container</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'my_tomcat_container'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">image</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">port_bindings</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">bindings</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This will have deployed the container and started it up for you, you can disable the automatic startup by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start=False</code> as a keyword argument. You can now call upon this container and 
run methods, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">restart</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stop</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">destroy</code>.</p>

<p>For example, to blow away that test container:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>   <span class="n">container</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">destroy</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 id="crossing-the-streams-calling-kubernetes-and-amazon-ec2-container-service">Crossing the streams; calling Kubernetes and Amazon EC2 Container Service</h2>

<p>With Docker we saw that we needed to “pull” the image before we deployed it. Kubernetes and Amazon ECS don’t have that requirement, but as a safeguard you can query the Docker Hub API using a 
utility class provided</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>   <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">libcloud.container.utils.docker</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">HubClient</span>
   <span class="n">hub</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">HubClient</span><span class="p">()</span>
   <span class="n">image</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">hub</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get_image</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'tomcat'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'8.0'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image</code> can be used to deploy to any driver instance that you create. Let’s try that against Kubernetes and ECS.</p>

<h3 id="amazon-ecs">Amazon ECS</h3>

<p>Before you run this example, you will need an API key and the permissions for that key to have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess</code> role. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ap-southeast-2</code> is my nearest region, but you can 
swap this out for any of the Amazon public regions that have the ECS service available.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>   <span class="n">e_cls</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">get_driver</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Provider</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ECS</span><span class="p">)</span>
   <span class="n">ecs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">e_cls</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">access_id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'SDHFISJDIFJSIDFJ'</span><span class="p">,</span>

</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>ECS and Kubernetes both support some form of grouping or clustering for your containers. This is available as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create_cluster</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">list_cluster</code>.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>   <span class="n">cluster</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ecs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">create_cluster</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'default'</span><span class="p">)</span>
   <span class="n">container</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ecs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">deploy_container</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">cluster</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">cluster</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'hello-world'</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="n">image</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">image</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="n">start</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">False</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="n">ex_container_port</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">8080</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ex_host_port</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">8080</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This will have deployed a task definition in Amazon ECS with a single container inside, with a cluster called ‘main’ and deployed the tomcat:8.0 image from the Docker hub to that region.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/container/drivers/ecs.html">ECS Documentation</a> for more details.</p>

<h3 id="kubernetes">Kubernetes</h3>

<p>Kubernetes authentication is currently only implemented for None (off) and Basic HTTP authentication. Let’s use the <a href="http://kubernetes.io/v1.1/docs/admin/authentication.html">basic HTTP authentication method</a> to connect.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">

  <span class="post-date-author">By Anthony Shaw on Jan 20, 2016</span>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>We are pleased to announce that version 1.0-pre1 vote thread is open and the release is ready for community feedback.</p>

<p>1.0-pre1 marks the first pre-release of the 1.0 major release. Some years ago, Tomaz Muraus spoke on the podcast <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly/episodes/181">FLOSS weekly</a>.
Tomaz spoke about how much of a huge challenge porting the project to Python 3.x would be(!) as well as the 1.0 milestone.</p>

<p>It is worth listening to the podcast to see how far things have come, we now average 2 pull-requests a day and have 156 contributors.</p>

<p>As the project has matured over the last 5 years one of the most remarkable changes has been the adoption from the community and 
continued support from our contributors adding new drivers, patching strange API issues and keeping the project alive.</p>

<p>Anthony Shaw will be speaking on the FLOSS weekly podcast on February 2nd and discussing our community and the project, so 
please tune in.</p>

<p>The Cloud market as I’m sure you’re all aware of is thriving, the purpose of Libcloud was originally:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To help prevent lock-in to a particular vendor</li>
  <li>To abstract the complexity of vendor APIs</li>
  <li>To give a simple way for deploying to and managing multiple cloud vendors</li>
</ul>

<p>Since that we have had (at the last count) 2,118,539 downloads. The project continues to grow in popularity with each new release.</p>

<p>So with the 1.0 major release we would like to announce 2 new driver types, containers and backup.</p>

<h2 id="history-of-our-drivers">History of our drivers</h2>

<p>The compute (IaaS) API is what libcloud is best known for but there is a range of drivers available for many other capabilities.</p>

<p>There is a presentation on the value of using Libcloud to avoid lock in <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AnthonyShaw5/apache-libcloud-keeping-up-with-the-cloud-market-in-2016">on SlideShare</a></p>

<p>This is a history of the different driver types in the libcloud project.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compute (v0.1.0)</li>
  <li>Support for nodes, node images, locations, states</li>
  <li>52 providers including every major cloud provider in the market. Plus local services like Vmware, OpenStack, libvirt</li>
  <li>DNS (v0.6.0)</li>
  <li>Support for zones, records, recordtypes</li>
  <li>19 providers including CloudFlare, DigitalOcean, DNSimple, GoDaddy, Google DNS, Linode, Rackspace, Amazon R53, Zerigo</li>
  <li>Object Storage (v0.5.0)</li>
  <li>Support for containers and objects</li>
  <li>11 providers including Amazon S3, Azure Blobs, Google storage, CloudFiles, OpenStack Swift</li>
  <li>Load Balancer (v0.5.0)</li>
  <li>Support for nodes, balancers, listeners and algorithms</li>
  <li>11 providers including CloudStack, Dimension Data, Amazon ELB, Google GCE LB, SoftLayer LB</li>
  <li>Backup (v0.20.0)</li>
  <li>Support for backup targets, recovery points and jobs</li>
  <li>3 providers, Dimension Data, Amazon EBS snaps, Google snaps</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introducing-backup-drivers">Introducing Backup Drivers</h2>

<p>With 1.0-pre1 we have introduced a new driver type for backup, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libcloud.backup</code></p>

<p>Backup API allows you to manage Backup as A Service and services such as EBS Snaps,
GCE volume snap and dimension data backup.</p>

<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libcloud.backup.base.BackupTarget</code> - Represents a backup target, like a Virtual Machine, a folder or a database.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libcloud.backup.base.BackupTargetRecoveryPoint</code> - Represents a copy of the data in the target, a recovery point can be
recovered to a backup target. An inplace restore is where you recover to the same target and an out-of-place restore is where you
recover to another target.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libcloud.backup.base.BackupTargetJob</code> - Represents a backup job running on backup target.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introducing-container-as-a-service-drivers">Introducing Container-as-a-Service Drivers</h2>

<p>The API is for Container-as-a-Service providers, these new types of cloud services offer container management and hosting as a service.
The new services are already providing proprietary APIs, giving the need for a tool like Libcloud if you want to provision to any cloud provider.</p>

<p>Google, Amazon and Joyent have all announced Container cloud services and Microsoft have launched a beta service also, so we are getting on the front foot with an
abstraction API for people wishing to gain similar benefits to the compute, load balancer and storage APIs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AnthonyShaw5/introducing-container-asaservice-support-to-apache-libcloud">A presentation on this topic is available on SlideShare.</a></p>

<p><strong>Isn’t docker a standard?</strong>
Well, yes and no.</p>

<p>Docker has been the main technology adopted by these providers as the host system for the containers and also as the specification of the containers themselves.
But, Docker is not a provisioning system, it is a virtualization host. Also there are alternatives, like CoreOS Rkt.</p>

<h3 id="container-api-design">Container API design</h3>

<p>Container-as-a-Service providers will implement the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ContainerDriver</code> class to provide functionality for :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Listing deployed containers</li>
  <li>Starting, stopping and restarting containers (where supported)</li>
  <li>Destroying containers</li>
  <li>Creating/deploying containers</li>
  <li>Listing container images</li>
  <li>Installing container images (pulling an image from a local copy or remote repository)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="simple-container-support">Simple Container Support</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libcloud.container.base.ContainerImage</code> - Represents an image that can be deployed, like an application or an operating system</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libcloud.container.base.Container</code> - Represents a deployed container image running on a container host</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cluster-suppport">Cluster Suppport</h3>

<p>Cluster support extends on the basic driver functions, but where drivers implement the class-level attribute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">supports_clusters</code> as True
clusters may be listed, created and destroyed. When containers are deployed, the target cluster can be specified.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libcloud.container.base.ContainerCluster</code> - Represents a deployed container image running on a container host</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libcloud.container.base.ClusterLocation</code> - Represents a location for clusters to be deployed</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="using-the-container-drivers">Using the container drivers</h3>

<p>The container drivers have been designed around similar principles to the compute driver. It is simple to use and a flat class design.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">

</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="container-registries">Container Registries</h3>

<p>The Docker Registry API is used by services like Amazon ECR, the Docker Hub website and by anyone hosting their own Docker registry.
It doesn’t belong to a particular driver, so is a utility class. 
Some providers, like Amazon ECR have a factory method to provide a registry client
Images from docker registry can be sent to the deploy_container method for any driver.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">libcloud.container.utils.docker</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">HubClient</span>

</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When other container registry services are made available these can be provided in a similar context.</p>

<h3 id="prototype-drivers-in-libcloudcontainer">Prototype drivers in libcloud.container</h3>

<p>Drivers have been provided to show example implementations of the API, these drivers are <strong>experimental</strong> and need to go through more thorough community testing
before they are ready for a stable release.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/container/drivers/docker.html">Docker</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/container/drivers/joyent.html">Joyent Triton</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/container/drivers/kubernetes.html">Google Kubernetes</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/container/drivers/ecs.html">Amazon Elastic Container Service (as well as Amazon Container Registry Service)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The driver with the most contentious implementation is Kubernetes. We would like users of the Amazon ECS, Google Containers and Kubernetes project to provide feedback
on how they would like to map clusters, pods, namespaces to the low level concepts in the driver.</p>

  <span class="post-date-author">By Tomaz Muraus on Jan 14, 2016</span>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>This is an announcement for users of the Linode driver for Libcloud who might
have started experiencing issues recently.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>A couple of Libcloud users have reported that they have recently started
experiencing issues when talking to the Linode API using Libcloud. They have
received messages similar to the one shown below.</p>

<pre>
socket.error: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer
</pre>

<p>It turns out that the issue is related to the used SSL / TLS version. For
compatibility and security reasons (Libcloud also supports older Python
versions), Libcloud uses TLS v1.0 by default.</p>

<p>Linode recently dropped support for TLS v1.0 and it now only support TLS &gt;=
v1.1. This means Libcloud won’t work out of the box anymore.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>If you are experiencing this issue, you should update your code to use TLS v1.2
or TLS v1.1 as shown below.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>import ssl

import libcloud.security
libcloud.security.SSL_VERSION = ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_1
# or even better if your system and Python version supports TLS v1.2
libcloud.security.SSL_VERSION = ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2

# Instantiate and work with the Linode driver here...
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Keep in mind that for this to work you need to have a recent version of OpenSSL
installed on your system and you need to use Python &gt;= 3.4 or Python 2.7.9.</p>

<p>For more details please see recently updated <a href="https://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/other/ssl-certificate-validation.html#changing-used-ssl-tls-version">documentation</a>. If you are
still experiencing issues or have any questions, please feel free to reach
us via the mailing list or IRC.</p>

<p>Note: Even if you are not experiencing any issues, it’s generally a good idea
to use the highest version of TLS supported by your system and the provider you
use.</p>

<h2 id="quick-note-on-sslprotocol_sslv23">Quick note on ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23</h2>

<p>Python uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23</code> constant by default. When this constant is
used, it will let client known to pick the highest protocol version which both
the client and server support (it will be selecting between SSL v3.0, TLS v1.0,
TLS v1.1 and TLS v1.2).</p>

<p>We use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23</code> for security
and compatibility reasons. SSL v3.0 is considered broken and unsafe and using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23</code> can result in an increased risk for a downgrade attack.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Jacob Riley, Steve V, Heath Naylor and everyone from

  <span class="post-date-author">By Tomaz Muraus on Nov 18, 2015</span>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Please help us extend a warm welcome to our newest team member <a href="https://github.com/tonybaloney">Anthony
Shaw</a>!</p>

<p>The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Libcloud has invited Anthony
Shaw to join us as a committer and a PMC member and we are pleased to announce
that he has accepted.</p>

<p>Anthony has joined the community fairly recently, but he has already made a lot
of <a href="https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Atonybaloney+is%3Aclosed">substantial contributions</a>. Those contributions range from new Dimension
Data drivers and various related improvements to a proposal for a new <a href="https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/629">backup
API</a> for Backup as a Service products and projects.</p>

<p>While we are talking about the new backup API - we would like to encourage
everyone who is either a service provider offering Backup as a Service product
or a person interested in using this API to join us and <a href="https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/629">participate in the
discussion</a>. The more feedback we get, the better and more widely applicable
we can make this new API.</p>

<p>For anyone who would like to know more about Anthony here is his short bio:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anthony Shaw works for the global system integrator Dimension Data as Head of
Innovation. Anthony has been working in the hosting/service provider industry
for the last 10 years for MSPs within Europe, North America and Australia in
various Product Management and Product Development roles. Anthony is an
open-source advocate and has been promoting the Libcloud project internally to
Dimension Data for the last 9 months as well as maintaining its driver.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in his own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think we will continue to see consolidation in IaaS providers over the next
12 months, so likelihood is the number of drivers will reduce, but the
importance of being cloud agnostic to people is becoming more apparent as some
are already being burnt by integrations into APIs that companies like Dell and
Ninefold have pulled the plug on. Libcloud is a key project for developers not
wanting to lock themselves too heavily to a vendor. I would also like to see
expansion of additional services like backup, load balancing and containers so
that users can still take advantages of these features through our driver.</p>

    <p>Github and DigitalOcean are organizing <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> again this year.</p>

<p>Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software where people
are encouraged to contribute to different open source projects. Each user who
submits four pull requests to any Github hosted open source project of their
choice will receive a free t-shirt.</p>

<div class="imginline">

</div>

<p>This year we are also happy to announce that we have been selected as one of
the highlighted Python projects which users are invited to check, play with it
and contribute to.</p>

<p>We think this is a great opportunity for both, long time users and contributors,
but especially people who are new to open source to learn how open source works
and participate.</p>

<p>Having said that, we would like to invite anyone who is interested to participate
and contribute to our project. You can find more information on contributing to
Libcloud in our <a href="https://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#contributing">contribution guide</a>.</p>

<p>For more information about the Hacktoberfest project itself and information on
how to sign up, please visit the <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">official website</a> and announcement blog post

  <span class="post-date-author">By Tomaz Muraus on Jan 23, 2014</span>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Today we are pleased to announce a new, improved and more user friendly version
of our website.</p>

<h3 id="background-and-history">Background and History</h3>

<p>Original website was developed and published back in 2009 when the project was
first announced.</p>

<p>A lot has changed since 2009 and during that time the web has been evolving at
a rapid pace. Now we have terms such as <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">responsive web design</a>, great
front-end frameworks for building responsive websites such as <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>
and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb</a> and many other new things which didn’t exist or weren’t widely
used back when we first launched.</p>

<p>During this time we focused most of our efforts on improving the code and
making the library better. This meant the website didn’t receive a lot of
needed love and attention so design-wise, it was mostly stuck in the 2009 era.</p>

<p>Over the years it has become apparent that presentation and documentation is
also equally or even more important then the code itself, so we have decided
to fix some of the “mistakes” we have made in the past.</p>

<p>A couple of months back we launched a <a href="https://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">new documentation</a> and today, we are
happy to present you a new and much improved website which was built with
modern tools and principles in mind.</p>

<h3 id="improvements-and-new-features">Improvements and New Features</h3>

<div class="imginline">
  <p><img src="/images/posts/tbd/preview.png" class="img-responsive inline" /></p>
  <p class="img-caption">Responsive design makes a site pleasure to use on a
  variety of devices and screen sizes. Image by placeit.net.</p>
</div>

<p>New website includes many improvements and new features. Some of the more
important ones are listed bellow.</p>

<h4 id="more-modern-and-user-friendly-design">More modern and user-friendly design</h4>

<p>New website now features a more modern and user-friendly design. This includes
bigger fonts, better typography and so on.</p>

<p>On top of that, the new design is fully responsive which means you can now
better enjoy the content on smaller devices such as mobile phones and tablets.</p>

<h4 id="improved-and-re-designed-landing-page">Improved and re-designed landing page</h4>

<p>We know that landing pages are very important so we have decided to totally
re-design and re-organise ours.</p>

<p>New landing page now displays all the important information (project features,
code examples, showcases some companies and projects using Libcloud) and also
features a more clear call to action.</p>

<h4 id="blog-section">Blog section</h4>

<p>New website now features a fully-fledged blog.</p>

<p>We will use the blog to post important project news, keep you up to date with
what is currently going on and post case studies and stories from projects and
companies which are using Libcloud.</p>

<p>If you are using an RSS reader to stay up to date, we also offer an
<a href="/blog/atom.xml">ATOM feed</a>.</p>

<h4 id="updated-credits-page">Updated Credits Page</h4>

<p><a href="/credits.html">Credits</a> page now features an up to date list of people who have
contributed code and documentation.</p>

<p>As noted on that page, the list is automatically generated from the CHANGES
file so it might not be 100% accurate.</p>

<h4 id="search-engine-optimizations">Search Engine Optimizations</h4>

<p>We have made some changes which will make our website a bit more friendly to
the web crawlers and search engines. We hope this will make it easier for you
to more quickly find the content you are looking for.</p>

<p>The changes we have made include improvements to the underlying HTML markup,
addition of the <a href="http://ogp.me/">OpenGraph</a> tags and an addition of a sitemap.</p>

<h3 id="under-the-hood">Under the Hood</h3>

<p>Old website was powered by <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/cms.html">Apache CMS</a>. It mostly worked good enough for
simple use cases, but a small user base means it lacks a large ecosystem around
it which is pretty standard for many other popular content management systems.</p>

<p>Because of that, we have decided to switch to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a Ruby based static
website and blog engine.</p>

<p>On top of that, the new website is fully responsive and built using
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 3</a> front-end framework.</p>

<p>Similar to the old website, source code is still stored in an SVN repository
so all the benefits we get from version control are preserved.</p>

<p>Source code of the new website can be found in the <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/libcloud/site/trunk/">SVN repository</a>.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>We hope you will like and enjoy the new website.</p>

<p>We also hope the new website now better reflects the underlying evolution of
the library and the direction we are heading.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions on how we can make the website even better, don’t
hesitate and share it with us. You can send your feedback to the
<a href="/community.html#mailing-lists">mailing list</a>, or you can <a href="/community.html#website-repository">checkout the website repository</a> and make
the changes yourself.</p>

  <span class="post-date-author">By Tomaz Muraus on Jan 01, 2014</span>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>This is a quick update about the recent 0.13.3 security release and the
DigitalOcean vulnerability.</p>

<p>DigitalOcean updated their blog post. The updated post says that
scrubbing is now enabled by default for all the newly issued destroy
requests:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All Destroys Default to Scrub</p>

  <p>We have updated the destroy method to scrub on all destroys, both for
web and API requests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that no action is required on the client side and upgrading

  <span class="post-date-author">By Tomaz Muraus on Dec 31, 2013</span>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>This release fixes a security issue with a potential leak of data contained on
a destroyed DigitalOcean node. Only users who are using a DigitalOcean driver
are affected.</p>

<h3 id="details-about-the-vulnerability">Details about the vulnerability</h3>

<p>DigitalOcean recently changed the default API behavior from scrub to
non-scrub when destroying a VM without notifying the customers and API
consumers.</p>

<p>Libcloud prior to this release doesn’t explicitly send “scrub_data” query
parameter when destroying a node. This means nodes which are destroyed using
Libcloud are vulnerable to later customers stealing data contained on them.</p>

<p>This release fixes that by always sending “scrub_data” query parameter when
destroying a DigitalOcean node.</p>

<p>If you are using a DigitalOcean driver, you are strongly encouraged to
upgrade (or downgrade if you are using 0.14.0-beta3 beta release) to this
release.</p>

<p>For more information, please see the <a href="/security.html#CVE-2013-6480">Security page</a>.</p>

  <span class="post-date-author">By Tomaz Muraus on Nov 21, 2013</span>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>We are pleased to announce the release of Libcloud 0.14.0-beta3, a first
(beta) release in the 0.14.0 series.</p>

<p>The reason this is a beta and not a final release is that it includes some
pretty big changes (most notably the “region” argument change). I would
like those changes to get some more real-life testing before doing a final
release.</p>

<p>Being a first release in the 0.14.0 series means it brings many (and I mean
many!) new features, changes and improvements.</p>

<h3 id="release-highlights">Release highlights</h3>

<ul>
  <li>To make working with providers which support multiple regions easier and
more user-friendly, some of the drivers have moved away from the “one
class per region” to a single class plus “region” argument model. Those
drivers include: EC2, Rackspace, ElasticHosts, Joyent, CloudFiles.</li>
  <li>Addition of a programmatic way of updating the pricing file and ability
to use a custom pricing file. For more information, please see the
<a href="https://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/compute/pricing.html#using-a-custom-pricing-file">documentation</a></li>
  <li>Addition of block storage management methods to the following drivers:
OpenNebula, OpenStack, EC2</li>
  <li>Unification of the extension arguments for handling security groups in
the EC2 and OpenStack driver</li>
  <li>Many new features and improvements in the CloudStack driver</li>
  <li>New compute and loadbalancer driver for Google Compute Engine (GCE)</li>
  <li>Ability to export Libcloud’s DNS zone to BIND zone format</li>
  <li>and much more!</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the changes noted above are also backward incompatible. For more
information on what has changed and how to update your code to work with
a new release, please visit the <a href="https://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/upgrade_notes.html#libcloud-0-14-0">Upgrade Notes</a> section in our
documentation.</p>

<h3 id="other-non-code-changes-worth-a-mention">Other non-code changes worth a mention</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Tests now also run on travis-ci - <a href="https://travis-ci.org/apache/libcloud">https://travis-ci.org/apache/libcloud</a></li>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Dear users, developers and team members!</p>

<p>2012 is slowly coming to an end and Libcloud team wishes everyone a happy
and successful new year 2013!</p>

<p>2012 has been another great year for us and we have surpassed 2011 in
pretty much every aspect.</p>

<p>Here is a short list of things which have been accomplished and important
events which have happened in 2012:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One new committer Ilgiz Islamgulov (ilgiz) has joined the team.</li>
  <li>We have another new commiter joining our team soon (Mahendra M).
Currently he is undergoing a process of submitting his ICLA.</li>
  <li>134 new JIRA issues have been opened (total of 271). Out of those 134
issues, 111 are now marked as ‘resolved’.</li>
  <li>SVN repository has had a total of 320 commit. More than 50% of those
commits were patches from external contributors.</li>
  <li>We had our first Google Summer of Code student which worked on a project
named “Libcloud REST” (https://github.com/islamgulov/libcloud.rest). The
goal of the project is to expose Libcloud functionality over HTTP.</li>
  <li>Tomaz gave a talk titled “Avoiding Vendor Lock-In Using Apache Libcloud”
at CloudOpen 2012 in San Diego</li>
  <li>We now finally have some more user friendly documentation and examples on
the website - http://libcloud.apache.org/docs/</li>
  <li>We held a first in person meetup at the Rackspace San Francisco office in
the beginning of the year (http://libcloudmeetup.eventbrite.com/)</li>
  <li>We had a total of 7 releases (0.8.0, 0.9.1, 0.10.1, 0.11.0, 0.11.1,
0.11.3, 0.11.4) and over 70.000 downloads / installs on PyPi (
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/apache-libcloud/)</li>
  <li>Github mirror has been starred by 266 users (
https://github.com/apache/libcloud)</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks again to everyone for their work and contributions and lets make
2013 even better :)</p>

<p>I will post those numbers in a more machine readable format (JSON) in the
next couple of weeks. This way it will be easier for us to track those
metrics on a year over year basis.</p>

<p>Numbers retrieved on: 2012-12-25.
Sources for those numbers: JIRA, Libcloud website, PyPi, Ohloh.net, Google
Analytics</p>

    <p>The Apache Libcloud team is pleased to announce the release of Libcloud
0.11.0!</p>

<p>Libcloud is a Python library that abstracts away the differences among

(servers, storage, load balancers, DNS) offered by many different providers
 through a single, unified and easy to use API.</p>

<h3 id="release-highlights">Release highlights</h3>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Install test files when installing the library. Tests module can now be
imported by doing something like this: “from libcloud import test”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Compute</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>New standard API and methods for managing storage volumes. Base API
consists of the following methods: create_volume, destroy_volume,
attach_volume, detach_volume.</li>
  <li>New driver for KT UCloud (http://home.ucloud.olleh.com/main.kt) based
on the CloudStack driver.</li>
  <li>New Gridspot driver with a basic list and destroy functionality.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Hello all,</p>

<p>Due to recent graduation (woho!), all the SVN repositories have been moved
and the mailing list addresses have also been changed.</p>

<p>If you are already subscribed to one of the old mailing list addresses your
subscription was automatically transfered to the new one so you don’t need
to do anything on your part.</p>

<p>New addresses can be found bellow.</p>

<p><strong>SVN repositories</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Main code repository: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/libcloud/</li>
  <li>Website repository:
https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/libcloud</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mailing lists addresses</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>dev@libcloud.apache.org (was libcloud@incubator.apache.org)</li>
  <li>commits@libcloud.apache.org from (was

  <li>
    <p>private@libcloud.apache.org from (was

  <li>security@libcloud.apache.org - new private mailing list used for reporting
security vulnerabilities</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="note-to-the-committers">Note to the committers</h2>

<p>CMS part of the website hasn’t been fully migrated yet. In the mean time,
please try to avoid editing raw HTML files, because this means we will need
to manually edit markdown files again when the CMS stuff is migrated.</p>

    <p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I just wanted to let everyone know that the Libcloud PMC has decided to
invite a new committer - Hutson Betts (hbetts).</p>

<p>He has previously mostly contributed to the OpenNebula driver and the
networking API.</p>

<p>We believe that granting him the committer status will allow him to more
easily and directly contribute to the project.</p>

<p>Please help us welcome him!</p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Libcloud team is pleased to announce the release of Libcloud 0.6.2!</p>

<p>This is primary a bug-fix release and includes the following bug-fixes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fix the PollingConnection class and actually use the poll_interval class
variable (previously it was ignored). This bug-fix affects Rackspace Cloud
DNS driver, CloudStack and Ninefold compute driver.</li>
  <li>Fix a bug in the Rackspace Cloud DNS driver exception handling and throw
an Exception if an unexpected status code is returned.</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides the bug-fixes it also includes some new features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for Amazon’s new location (Oregon)</li>
  <li>Expose CloudStack provider. This way it can be used with an arbitrary
CloudStack installation and not just with the provider drivers which
sub-class it (e.g. Ninefold.com driver).</li>
</ul>

  <span class="post-date-author">By Tomaz Muraus on May 25, 2011</span>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Hello all,</p>

<p>I would like to announce Libcloud 0.5.0. This version represents a big
milestone, because it includes many new features, drivers, improvement and
two totally new API’s - storage and load-balancers.</p>

<h3 id="major-changes-and-features-since-the-last-release">Major changes and features since the last release</h3>

<p><strong>New Storage API</strong></p>

<p>Storage API which allows you to manage cloud storage has been added to the
core. Currently two provider drivers are available (Rackspace Cloud Files
and Amazon S3), but you can expect more drivers in the future releases.</p>

<p><strong>New load-balancer API</strong></p>

<p>Load-balancer API which allows you to manage load-balancers as a service
(LBaaS) has been added to the core. Currently two provider drivers are
available (Rackspace and GoGrid), but you can expect more drivers in the
future releases.</p>

<p><strong>New compute drivers</strong></p>

<p>This release includes 5 new compute drivers. The compute API now supports a
total of 24 different providers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bluebox (contributed by Christian Paredes)</li>
  <li>Gandi.net (contributed by Aymeric Barantal)</li>
  <li>Nimbus (contributed by David LaBissoniere)</li>
  <li>OpenStack (contributed by Roman Bogorodskiy)</li>
  <li>Opsource.net cloud (contributed by Joe Miller)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="api-changes">API changes</h3>

<p>To support new services, core Libcloud API had to be refactored. The library
now consists of three top-level modules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>libcloud.compute.* (everything related to the compute has been moved here)</li>
  <li>libcloud.storage.* (new place for the storage API)</li>
  <li>libcloud.loadbalancer.* (new place for the load-balancer API)</li>
</ul>

<p>Importing stuff from the old location (e.g. from libcloud.providers import
get_driver) should still work, but you will receive a deprecation warning.</p>

<p>You are encouraged to update your code to use the new module locations. The
old paths will be fully deprecated and removed in version 0.6.0.</p>

<h3 id="other-notable-changes">Other notable changes</h3>

<p>All the pricing data has been moved to a separate JSON file. This should
make updating pricing a lot easier.</p>

<p>For a full list of changes, please check the CHANGES file &lt;
https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/trunk/CHANGES&gt;.</p>

<h3 id="download">Download</h3>

<p>Libcloud 0.5.0 can be downloaded from
http://libcloud.apache.org/downloads.html or install it using pip - pip
install apache-libcloud</p>

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>

<p>For the API documentation, please refer to
https://libcloud.apache.org/apidocs/0.5.0/</p>

<p>For a real world example, check the example_{compute,storage,balancer}.py
files which are located in the root directory.</p>

<p>We have been pretty busy with this release so we currently don’t have any
articles about the new APIs on the website yet, but we will try to add them
this week.</p>

<h3 id="bugs--issues">Bugs / Issues</h3>

<p>If you find any bug or issue, please report it on our issue tracker (
