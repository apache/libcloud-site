    <p>Please help us extend a warm welcome to our newest team member <a href="https://github.com/micafer">Miguel Caballer</a>!</p>

<p>The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Libcloud has invited Miguel
Caballer to join us as a committer and we are pleased to announce that he
has accepted.</p>

<p>Miguel has been part of the Libcloud community for many years now and during
his participation he made various contributions to the project, majority of
them focusing on our OpenStack drivers.</p>

<p>For anyone who would like to know more about Miguel here is his short bio:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Miguel Caballer is part of the Grid and High Performance Computing group of
UPV since 2001. He is the lead developer of the Infrastructure Manager (IM),
a tool that deploys complex and customized virtual infrastructures on IaaS
Cloud deployments. He has participated in different research projects about
the application of Grid and Cloud computing techniques to several areas of
engineering. Other fields of interest include green computing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in his own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I start the development of the IM (in python) I found that Libcloud was
the best option to connect with different cloud back-ends using a single
library and using the same basic set of functions calls. It has improved a
lot in the last years adding extra functionality for each connector that makes
it a really good alternative to native libraries. My main contributions has been
mainly related with the OpenStack driver, one of the most user cloud providers
by the IM tool. I’m very proud to be an Apache Libcloud team member and I will
continue with my contributions.</p>

<p>The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Libcloud has invited Clemens
Wolff to join us as a committer and we are pleased to announce that he

<p>Clemens has participated in the Libcloud community for a while now and during

<p>For anyone who would like to know more about Clemens here is his short bio:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clemens Wolff is a tech lead in Microsoft’s Commercial Software
Engineering team, enabling customers from around the world to create scalable,
resilient and efficient software solutions applying relevant technologies and
platforms, including cloud computing, highly scalable data engines, machine
learning and analytics, and distributed messaging systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in his own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was introduced to Libcloud while working with a research group at Imperial
College London on porting OKpy, an open source computer science classroom
management system, from GCP to Azure. OKpy uses Libcloud which made
migrating the object storage needs of the application a breeze. Since this
initial exposure, I’ve been using Libcloud on many projects to ensure
cross-cloud compatibility and to simplify testing via the local provider
implementations. Most of my contributions have been about maintaining and
updating the Azure implementation of Libcloud’s storage driver and
building test automation to ensure that Libcloud can seamlessly be used
with Azure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are happy to have him in our team and we are looking forward to his future
participation and contributions.</p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Please help us extend a warm welcome to our newest team member <a href="https://github.com/vdloo">Rick van de
Loo</a>!</p>

<p>The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Libcloud has invited Rick
van de Loo to join us as a committer and we are pleased to announce that he
has accepted.</p>

<p>In the last couple of years Rick has <a href="https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avdloo+is%3Aclosed">contributed various high quality
changes</a> to the project and we are happy to have him on board.</p>

<p>For anyone who would like to know more about Rick here is his short bio:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rick van de Loo is the lead developer on Hypernode, a highly automated and
cloud agnostic hosting platform specialised for Magento built on top of Apache
Libcloud. Since Rick started working on Hypernode he has seen it scale from
double digits to thousands of servers, along the road orchestrating various
high volume cross-provider migrations. His main focus is on platform
stability and feature development, of which a large part has been integrating
cloud APIs and working around their incompatibilities and unreliable nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in his own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since we started using Libcloud around four years ago the landscape has
changed a lot. But even though container-based and serverless architectures
have become more prominent, compute is still the cornerstone of cloud. Most
of my contributions have been about standardising functionality across
different compute providers and implementing new driver methods, mainly
related to the AWS, DigitalOcean and OpenStack APIs. As an Apache Libcloud
team member I will continue to contribute changes that help us scratch our
own itch and encourage other members of the Hypernode team to do the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are happy to have him in our team and we are looking forward to his future
participation and contributions.</p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Please help us extend a warm welcome to our newest team member <a href="https://github.com/tonybaloney">Anthony
Shaw</a>!</p>

<p>The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Libcloud has invited Anthony
Shaw to join us as a committer and a PMC member and we are pleased to announce
that he has accepted.</p>

<p>Anthony has joined the community fairly recently, but he has already made a lot
of <a href="https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Atonybaloney+is%3Aclosed">substantial contributions</a>. Those contributions range from new Dimension
Data drivers and various related improvements to a proposal for a new <a href="https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/629">backup
API</a> for Backup as a Service products and projects.</p>

<p>While we are talking about the new backup API - we would like to encourage
everyone who is either a service provider offering Backup as a Service product
or a person interested in using this API to join us and <a href="https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/629">participate in the
discussion</a>. The more feedback we get, the better and more widely applicable
we can make this new API.</p>

<p>For anyone who would like to know more about Anthony here is his short bio:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anthony Shaw works for the global system integrator Dimension Data as Head of
Innovation. Anthony has been working in the hosting/service provider industry
for the last 10 years for MSPs within Europe, North America and Australia in
various Product Management and Product Development roles. Anthony is an
open-source advocate and has been promoting the Libcloud project internally to
Dimension Data for the last 9 months as well as maintaining its driver.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in his own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think we will continue to see consolidation in IaaS providers over the next
12 months, so likelihood is the number of drivers will reduce, but the
importance of being cloud agnostic to people is becoming more apparent as some
are already being burnt by integrations into APIs that companies like Dell and
Ninefold have pulled the plug on. Libcloud is a key project for developers not
wanting to lock themselves too heavily to a vendor. I would also like to see
expansion of additional services like backup, load balancing and containers so
that users can still take advantages of these features through our driver.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are happy to have him in our team and we are looking forward to his future
participation and contributions.</p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Libcloud
has asked Ilgiz Islamgulov to become a committer and we are pleased
to announce that they have accepted.</p>

<p>Ilgiz worked on the Libcloud REST GSoC project
(http://libcloud.apache.org/gsoc-2012.html) this summer and he has made a
great progress on it.</p>

<p>Giving him commit access will allow him to more directly contribute to the
project and work on integrating Libcloud REST into main line.</p>

<p>Everyone, please help me welcome him to the team :)</p>

    <p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I just wanted to let everyone know that the Libcloud PMC has decided to
invite a new committer - Hutson Betts (hbetts).</p>

<p>He has previously mostly contributed to the OpenNebula driver and the
networking API.</p>

<p>We believe that granting him the committer status will allow him to more
easily and directly contribute to the project.</p>

<p>Please help us welcome him!</p>
